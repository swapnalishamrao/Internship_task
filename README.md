ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸš€ In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Technologies Used for this project, I primarily utilized the following tools and technologies: Python for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and model implementation. Jupyter Notebook as the coding environment for interactive development. Keras library to build and train the LSTM model.

Titanic Classification : Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. Key Features: Here,
Data Preprocessing is done i;e handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare the data for machine learning. Model Building: Utilize a XGBoost Classifier & Random Forest classifier to train the prediction model on the labeled training dataset. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy percent. Visualization: Explore survival trends based on different factors using interactive and informative plots. Predictions: Generate predictions for the test dataset Insights: Gain valuable insights into the factors that might have influenced survival during the Titanic disaster

MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Network
 we're working with the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digit images. We've prepared the data by scaling it appropriately. We've created two models for recognizing these digits. The first model is simple, while the second one has an additional hidden layer for better performance. Both models are trained to predict the digits and are evaluated based on their accuracy. We also create a confusion matrix to see how well each model performs on different digit classes. Finally, we display some random test images, along with their true labels and the labels predicted by the more complex model with the hidden layer.
